# Grey-Box-Login-and-Signup

This is an example Login/Signup form that is programmed using HTML/CSS3 with heavy emphasis on AngularJS.

The authentication and registration is used by using Googleâ€™s Firebase backend service which gives you tons of control on user management and live updates.

Still adding features to this form.
